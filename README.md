# speech-to-text-transcription
Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a neural network-based approach to automatic speech transcription. It walks through the key stages of the pipeline including:

Data loading and preprocessing: Audio files are processed into a format suitable for model training.

Model architecture: A neural model (e.g., RNN, Transformer, or pretrained ASR model) is configured for speech-to-text transcription.

Training and evaluation: The model is trained on a dataset and evaluated for transcription accuracy.

Inference: Given an input audio, the trained model outputs its transcribed text.

Key Features
Utilizes deep learning for sequence-to-sequence audio transcription.

Configurable parameters for model architecture and training.

Supports visualization of training metrics and sample transcriptions.

Includes comments and explanations for reproducibility and clarity.

Requirements
Python â‰¥ 3.7
